Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that allows applications to communicate with blockchain networks by sending requests and receiving responses over the internet. JSON-RPC, a lightweight and widely adopted format, is commonly used in blockchain applications to facilitate remote interactions with networks over HTTP or WebSockets.

At Gateway.fm, RPC provides developers with seamless access to supported blockchains, enabling them to:
- Query blockchain data, such as account balances, transactions, and blocks.
- Send transactions and interact with smart contracts.
- Retrieve network-specific information, including gas fees and chain IDs.
- Subscribe to real-time blockchain events (if supported by the network).

By leveraging RPC, developers can integrate blockchain functionality into their applications without the complexity of running their own nodes. This allows for efficient, secure, and scalable interactions with decentralized networks.

### How RPC Works at Gateway.fm
Gateway.fm offers high-performance, globally distributed RPC endpoints that provide:
- **Low-latency, high-availability access** across multiple geographic regions (Zurich, Frankfurt, Singapore).
- **Reliable, distributed infrastructure** to ensure redundancy and uptime.
- **Optimized performance** through region-based deployments, reducing request response times.
- **Scalability** with support for up to **10,000 requests per second**.
- **99.9% SLA** (Service Level Agreement) to guarantee high availability.

### Libraries for Using RPC
Developers can integrate Gateway.fm RPC endpoints using popular libraries:
- **ethers.js** – A lightweight JavaScript library for interacting with blockchain RPC endpoints. 
- **web3.py** – A Python library for interacting with Ethereum-based blockchains.
