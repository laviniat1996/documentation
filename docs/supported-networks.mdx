## What Are RPC Regions?
RPC (Remote Procedure Call) regions determine where Gateway.fm's infrastructure processes API requests. Each region hosts nodes for specific blockchain networks, ensuring lower latency, better redundancy, and improved performance for users in different geographic locations. Selecting the closest region reduces request response times and enhances stability for blockchain interactions.
