## What is the JSON-RPC API Playground?

The [**JSON-RPC API Playground**](https://gateway-rpc-playground.vercel.app/) is an interactive tool designed to help developers:
- Explore JSON-RPC methods available on the blockchain networks supported by us.
- Modify request parameters and test API calls.
- View real-time responses from the selected network.

## How to Use the Playground

### Select a Network
Use the **Select Network** dropdown to choose a blockchain network. This determines which RPC endpoint your requests will be sent to.

### Enter Your API Key
- Paste your into the input field.  
- If you don't have an API key already, please check out [this guide](../docs/get-api-key.mdx) on how to obtain one.

### Choose a Method
- Use the **Method** dropdown to select a JSON-RPC method.  

### Modify Parameters (Optional)
- The **Parameters (JSON array)** field contains example parameters for the selected method.  
- Replace each value with your own if needed.

### Send the Request
- Click **Send Request** to make an API call.  
- The response will appear in the **Response** section.
